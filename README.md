Guided Experiment Design (GED) API

The GED API provides the functionality of CEF and resource aware constraint
solving to enable more complex experimenter UIs.  While not all experimenter
interfaces will need the GED API (and instead will directly call into CEF's
API to instantiate experiments), experiments that are designed through an
interactive and/or constraint-based process can benefit by using the GED
functionality.
